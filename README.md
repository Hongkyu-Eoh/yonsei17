# Energy Materials: Design, Discovery and Data

## Overview 

This intensive graduate course at Yonsei University aims to address challenges for developing materials for clean energy technologies. Using a combination of lectures and interactive practical sessions, we will cover:

### Materials Design
* overview of semiconductor chemistry and physics
* materials science of solar energy conversion
* design principles for energy technologies

### Materials Discovery
* first-principles materials modelling
* using Python for science and engineering 
* identifying structures and compositions (via [Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org) and [SMACT](https://github.com/WMD-group/SMACT))

### Materials Data 
* high-throughput screening
* processing and plotting data 
* mining materials information
