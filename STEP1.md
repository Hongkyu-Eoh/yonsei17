# Energy Materials: Design, Discovery and Data

## Before we begin

### GitHub

[Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)) is a general purpose control system for software development. [Github](https://github.com) is a web-based Git hosting service. You do not need to know more, but there is a good introduction [here](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) and a short Git course on [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git). You can simply download this repository using the green button on the top-right of the [front page](https://github.com/WMD-group/yonsei17). 

### Python

> [Why scientists should learn to program in Python](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=9477755&fileId=S0885715614000931) [(pdf link)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/EB88FFCC7384998768AFDAE219EF6EFA/S0885715614000931a.pdf/div-class-title-why-scientists-should-learn-to-program-in-python-div.pdf)

[Python](http://python.org) is a popular programming language. It is now widely used in science and engineering research.  Our standard is Python 3. It can be a little tricky to install, so here are some tips:

#### Apple OSX
There are several options: (i) run [Scipy Superpack for Homebrew](http://stronginference.com/ScipySuperpack/)
or (ii) install
[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and additional packages from the [Terminal](http://www.imore.com/how-use-terminal-mac-when-you-have-no-idea-where-start) with `pip3 install matplotlib numpy jupyter numericalunits  eq_band_diagram SMACT`

#### Windows 
The simplest approach is the [Anaconda package](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) (choose Python 3).

#### Linux
It is probably already installed. 
Check with `python --version`. 
You can add all of the packages you need with the 
`pip3` command given above.

###  Jupyter Notebook

[Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) facilitates free open source, interactive data science and scientific computing across over 40 programming languages. It originated from the `IPython` project that was specific to the Python language. Simply run `jupyter notebook` from the command line.

### Flipped Classroom 
> "Flipped Learning is a pedagogical approach in which direct instruction moves from the group learning space to the individual learning space, and the resulting group space is transformed into a dynamic, interactive learning environment where the educator guides students as they apply concepts and engage creatively in the subject matter.’’ [Chem. Educ. Res. Pract. (2015)](http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2015/RP/C5RP00136F#!divAbstract)

Practically, we want to get you involved in the lectures. There will be some advance reading, but it means that we get more out of our time in class.
